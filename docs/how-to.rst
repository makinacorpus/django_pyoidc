Display custom message on login/logout
======================================

This library provides a hook system to call custom code. Hooks are configured on an identity provider basis.
In this guide we will setup two hook function that add login/logout messages using `Django's message system
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/messages/>`_.

First, if you don't already have a Python module holding OIDC related code in your projet, create a file
named ``oidc.py`` next to your settings.

Add in those two functions :

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import messages

    def login_function(request, user):
        messages.success(request, f"Welcome '{user.username}', you have been logged in")


    def logout_function(request, logout_request_args):
        messages.success(
            request, f"{request.user.username}, you have been logged out successfully"
        )


Next, we plug those functions in the library configuration. In your ``settings.py`` you should set the
``hook_user_login`` and ``hook_user_logout`` to point to those two functions.

Here is how it looks if we extend the configuration made in :ref:`Configure the library` :

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: settings.py

    DJANGO_PYOIDC = {
        # This is the name that your identity provider will have within the library
        "sso": {
            # change the following line to use your provider
            "provider_class": "django_pyoidc.providers.keycloak_18.Keycloak18Provider",

            # your secret should not be stored in settings.py, load them from an env variable
            "client_secret": os.getenv("SSO_CLIENT_SECRET"),
            "client_id": os.getenv("SSO_CLIENT_ID"),

            # Your autodiscovery url should go here
            "provider_discovery_uri": "https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/fixme",

            # This setting allow the library to cache the provider configuration auto-detected using
            # the `provider_discovery_uri` setting
            "oidc_cache_provider_metadata": True,

            # New configuration
            'hook_user_login' : 'my_project.oidc.login_function',
            'hook_user_logout' : 'my_project.oidc.logout_function'
        },


See :ref:`Hook settings <settings_hook>` for more information on the function path syntax.

You should now see a message on login/logout ! ðŸŽ‰

Make sure that you modified your template to display messages. See
:func:`django:django.contrib.messages.get_messages` for more information.


Customize how token data is mapped to User attributes
=====================================================

When a user succesfully logs-in, we provide an implementation that maps the received OIDC token to
``User`` model instances. The default implementation extracts the email and the username from the token
and uses it to create a User instance.

However you can implement more complex behaviour by specifying a :ref:`hook_get_user` in your setting
configuration. In this guide we will look at the ``groups`` attribute in a userinfo token and set the
:attr:`is_staff <django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_staff>` attribute depending on the value.

First, if you don't already have a Python module holding OIDC related code in your projet, create a file
named ``oidc.py`` next to your settings.

Add in a function that takes one arguments : a list of tokens received during the authentication process. There are multiple tokens because OIDC defines multiple tokens, and some providers put the information in one token an some in an other one :
* the userinfo token
* the access token

We provide the function ``django_pyoidc.utils.extract_claim_from_tokens`` to extract a *claim* (a key) from the list of tokens.

Let's start our implementation by reusing the default implementation provided by this library:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django_pyoidc import get_user_by_email
    def get_user(tokens):
        # Here, we reuse the implementation of our library
        user = get_user_by_email(tokens)
        return user

.. tip::

    To see what kind of data is available, you can print the content of tokens in this function.

    If you use Keycloak, you should have something like this for the userinfo token:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
          "sub": "40861311-0c53-4ad9-bc5c-d5fee81b0503",
          "email_verified": true,
          "name": "Admin User",
          "groups": [
            "basic-users",
            "default-role-my-realm",
            "admins"
          ],
          "preferred_username": "admin",
          "given_name": "Admin",
          "family_name": "User",
          "email": "admin@example.com"
        }

Since we are familiar with OIDC tokens, we know that we want to check the ``groups`` claim, and look for a
group named *admin*. If you are not familiar with the claims available in your tokens, print them !

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django_pyoidc.utils import extract_claim_from_tokens

    def get_user(userinfo_token, id_token):
        # Here, we reuse the implementation of our library
        user = get_user_by_email(tokens)
        groups = extract_claim_from_tokens('groups', tokens)
        user.is_staff = "admins" in groups
        user.save()
        return user


To have this function called instead of the default one, you need to modify your settings so that :ref:`hook_get_user` points to the function that we just wrote.

The value of this setting should be : ``<my_app>.oidc:login_function`` (see :ref:`Hook settings <settings_hook>` for more information on this syntax).

If you configured your settings manually (without using the providers system), you can add the key directly.

Edit your configuration to add the following key to your provider settings :

.. code-block:: python

    DJANGO_PYOIDC = {
        'sso' : {
            'hook_get_user' : 'my_app.oidc:get_huser' # <- my_app is a placeholder, alter it for your root module
        }
    }


Add application-wide access control rules based on audiences
============================================================

**TODO**

Open ID Connect supports a system of audience which can be used to indicate the list of applications a user has access to.

In order to implement access control based on the audience, you need to hook the :ref:`hook_get_user` to add your own logic.

In this guide, we will start from what we did in :ref:`Customize how token data is mapped to User attributes` and add audience based access control.

By the specification, the audience in a token is a list of strings or a single string,
so let's .....
Since we already defined our client ID in the settings, we fetch it from there ! This example assumes that your provider is named `keycloak`.


.. code-block:: python


    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django_pyoidc.utils import extract_claim_from_tokens
    from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied
    from django.conf import settings

    def get_user(userinfo_token, id_token):
        audiences = extract_clam_from_tokens("aud", tokens)

        # Perform audience check
        if settings.DJANGO_PYOIDC["keycloak"]["client_id"] not in audiences:
            raise PermissionDenied("You do not have access to this application")

        user = get_user_by_email(tokens)
        groups = extract_claim_from_tokens('groups', tokens)
        user.is_staff = "admins" in groups
        user.save()
        return user


Use the Django permission system with OIDC
==========================================

Django provides a rich authentication system that handles groups and permissions.

In this guide we will map Keycloak groups to Django groups. This allows one to manage group level permissions using Django system,
while keeping all the advantages of an Identity Provider to manage a user base.

In order to add users to groups on login, you need to hook the :ref:`hook_get_user`.

We will start from what we did in :ref:`Customize how token data is mapped to User attributes` and add group management.

In the *userinfo token* we can expect to find a 'groups' key (if available) and use it to query Django Groups models.

Here is how to do it :

.. code-block:: python


    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django_pyoidc.utils import extract_claim_from_tokens

    def get_user(userinfo_token, id_token):
        # Here, we reuse the implementation of our library
        user = get_user_by_email(tokens)
        groups = extract_claim_from_tokens('groups', tokens)
        user.is_staff = "admins" in groups

        for group_name in groups:
            group, _ = Group.objects.get_or_create(name=group_name)
            group.user_set.add(user)
            group.save()

        user.save()
        return user

And that's it. Groups will be created on the fly as your users connect to your application.
Then, you can grant group level permissions and it will be applied to your users.

.. note::
    For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial users are only added to groups. However you might also want to remove user
    from groups depending on your use cases.

Redirect the user after login
=============================

**TODO**

By default the ``success_redirect`` url defined in your provider is used to redirect the user after login.

If you want a more complex redirection (like maybe a dynamic redirection based on the current user navigation)
you can build something TODO:

Here is an example of a login button redirecting the user to the page named "profile" :

.. code-block:: python

    import urllib

    from django.urls import reverse
    from django.views import View

    class RedirectDemo(View):
        http_method_names = ["get"]

        def get(self):
            # From : https://realpython.com/django-redirects/#passing-parameters-with-redirects
            base_url = reverse("my-oidc-provider-login")
            query_string = urllib.parse.urlencode({"next": reverse("profile")})
            return redirect(f"{base_url}?{query_string}")

However you will need to tweak the settings according to your use-case. You should take a look at  :ref:`login_redirection_requires_https` and :ref:`login_uris_redirect_allowed_hosts`.

TODO: RedirectDemo now exists, where do I connect it?

Use multiple identity providers
===============================

This library natively supports multiples identity providers.

You already have to specify a provider name when you configure your settings (either automatically by using a provider, or :ref:`manually <provider-class-setting>`).

In a multi-provider setup, the settings look like this :

.. code-block:: python

    DJANGO_PYOIDC = {
        'oidc_provider_name_1' : {
            'client_id' : '' # <- provider 1 settings here
        }
        'oidc_provider_name_2' : {
            'client_id' : '' # <- provider 2 settings here
        }
     }

Then you have to include all your provider url configuration in your ``urlpatterns``. Since view names includes the identity provider name,
they should not collide.

Here is an example of such a configuration :

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: urls.py

    from .oidc import oidc_provider_1, oidc_provider_2

    urlpatterns = [
        path("auth", include((oidc_helper.get_urlpatterns(), "oidc_provider_name_1"), namespace="auth"),),
        path("auth", include((oidc_helper.get_urlpatterns(), "oidc_provider_name_2"), namespace="auth"),),
    ]

You can then use those view names to redirect a user to one or the other provider.

This will create 4 views for each provider in your URL configuration. They all have a name that derives from the ``op_name`` that you used to create your provider :

* ``<op_name>-login``
* ``<op_name>-logout``
* ``<op_name>-callback``
* ``<op_name>-backchannel-logout``

Since settings are local to a provider, you can also provide different :ref:`hook_get_user` for each to implement custom
behaviours based on which identity provider a user is coming from.
